> Today I Learned

A collection of things I have learned everyday. This is a note for my future self. Some will be published (or already) into articles. Heavily inspired by [this TIL repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

You can read my published articles [here](https://dev.to/mustafamilyas).
